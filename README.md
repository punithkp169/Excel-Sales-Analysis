# Excel-Sales-Analysis

## Problem Statement:
The objective is to analyze sales performance across different regions, states, and days of the week to gain insights into sales trends, identify high-performing areas, and understand how sales vary over time. This information can help in making informed business decisions such as identifying which regions need more marketing efforts or determining the best days to launch promotions.

## Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel:
- **Power Query Editor**: Used for data cleaning and transformation, such as removing duplicates, filtering data, and shaping it into a usable format.
- **Pivot Tables**: Employed to aggregate and summarize data, allowing for the easy creation of the KPIs.
- **Charts (Line, Pie, Map)**: Utilized for data visualization to present the insights in an understandable manner.
